 ### FIGURE-01 RASPI PI 4 PINOUT DIAGRAM: 

The Raspberry Pi 4 Model B is built around a Broadcom BCM2711 system-on-chip that integrates a quad-core ARM Cortex-A72 (64-bit) CPU, VideoCore VI GPU, memory controller, and peripheral interfaces, forming a compact yet complete computer architecture where the SoC connects internally to RAM, USB 3.0 controller, Gigabit Ethernet, HDMI display, and wireless modules. Its 40-pin GPIO header provides a flexible pin configuration consisting of power pins (5 V and 3.3 V), multiple ground pins, and general-purpose input/output pins that operate at 3.3 V logic and can be programmed for digital I/O or alternate functions. Key alternate functions include I²C (SDA, SCL) for sensor communication, SPI (MOSI, MISO, SCLK, CS) for high-speed peripheral interfacing, UART (TX, RX) for serial communication, and PWM for control applications.  For communication, I2C (SDA, SCL), SPI (MOSI, MISO, SCK), and UART (TX, RX) interfaces are mapped across different GPIO pins, allowing seamless connectivity with sensors and peripherals. All GPIO pins support PWM (Pulse Width Modulation), making it useful for motor control, LED brightness adjustment, and sound applications. The BOOTSEL button enables USB mass storage mode for firmware flashing, while the DEBUG pins (SWD interface) provide debugging capabilities. With its low power consumption, flexible GPIO options, and rich interface support, the Raspberry Pi Pico is widely used for IoT, embedded systems, robotics, and automation projects.This architecture and pin multiplexing allow the Raspberry Pi 4 to act as both a general-purpose computing platform and an embedded controller, supporting rapid prototyping, hardware interfacing, and IoT applications.

   The Internet of Things (IoT) allows devices to communicate and exchange data over the internet. In this experiment, Raspberry Pi 4 acts as the central processing unit that reads input signals from sensors and communicates with the Blynk cloud platform. The IR sensor detects the presence of objects, while the LDR sensor detects the intensity of light. These sensor values are transmitted to the Blynk mobile application for real-time monitoring. Based on the sensor data or manual commands from the Blynk app, Raspberry Pi controls output devices such as an LED, buzzer, and relay through its GPIO pins. This experiment demonstrates remote monitoring and control using IoT technology.

### **Circuit Diagram Explanation:**  
The IR sensor and LDR sensor are connected to the input GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi. These sensors detect environmental conditions such as object presence and light intensity and send digital signals to the Raspberry Pi.
The LED, buzzer, and relay module are connected to the output GPIO pins. These devices act as output indicators or control devices. The relay can control external electrical loads, while the LED and buzzer provide visual and audio alerts.
Raspberry Pi connects to the internet through Wi-Fi and communicates with the Blynk cloud server. The Blynk mobile application displays the sensor values and allows the user to control the output devices remotely. When a command is given from the Blynk app, Raspberry Pi processes the command and activates or deactivates the connected output devices.

 ### FIGURE-02 CIRCUIT DIAGRAM: 
 
### **IR Sensor:**  
  An **Infrared Sensor (IR Sensor)** is an electronic device used to detect the presence of objects by using **infrared light**. It consists mainly of an **IR transmitter (IR LED)** and an **IR receiver (photodiode or phototransistor)**. The transmitter emits infrared rays, and when these rays strike an object, they are reflected back and detected by the receiver. Based on this reflection, the sensor determines whether an object is present or absent. IR sensors are widely used in applications such as **obstacle detection, automatic doors, security systems, and line-following robots** due to their fast response and simple operation.

### FIGURE-03 IR Sensor

### **LDR Sensor:**  
   An **Light Dependent Resistor (LDR)** is a light-sensitive electronic sensor whose electrical resistance changes according to the intensity of incident light. When the surrounding light level increases, the resistance of the LDR decreases, allowing more current to flow through the circuit; conversely, in low-light or dark conditions its resistance becomes very high and restricts current flow. This property makes the LDR useful for automatically detecting and responding to light levels in applications such as automatic street lights, brightness control systems, security alarms, and light-activated switching circuits.

### **Relay Model:**  
   A **relay module** is an electrically operated switch used to control high-voltage or high-current devices using a low-power control signal from a microcontroller such as a Raspberry Pi or Arduino. It works based on an electromagnetic principle: when a small voltage is applied to the relay coil, it generates a magnetic field that pulls a switch contact to either open or close the circuit. This allows the microcontroller to safely control external loads like lamps, motors, or appliances without direct electrical connection. Relay modules usually include control pins (VCC, GND, IN) and switching terminals such as Normally Open (NO), Normally Closed (NC), and Common (COM).

### FIGURE-05 Relay Model

### **LED:**  
   A **Light Emitting Diode (LED)** is a semiconductor electronic component that emits light when an electric current passes through it. It operates on the principle of electroluminescence, where electrons recombine with holes inside the semiconductor material and release energy in the form of light. LEDs are widely used in **electronic circuits as indicators, displays, and lighting device**s because they consume very low power, have a **long lifespan, generate less heat, and switch very fast compared to conventional light source**s. They are available in different colors such as **red, green, blue, and white** depending on the semiconductor material used.

### FIGURE-06 LED

### **Buzzer:**  
   A **buzzer** is an electronic audio signaling device used to produce sound for alerts, alarms, or indications in electronic circuits. It converts electrical energy into sound energy and is commonly used in devices such as alarms, timers, computers, and embedded systems. Buzzers are mainly of two types: **active buzzers**, which generate sound when a DC voltage is applied, and **passive buzzers**, which require an external signal or frequency to produce sound. They are widely used in microcontroller and Raspberry Pi projects to provide audible notifications when a specific event or condition occurs.
